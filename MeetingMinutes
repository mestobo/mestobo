==========
* Changes in GUI: Form framework begun, Validation inserted, HL7 ADT Building begun
* CI Pipeline setup
* No decision yet concerning __ variables
* Validation: Use warnings for stuff that SHOULD be filled but can (purposely) be ignored (e.g. last name for ADT), 
  use error for stuff that makes the very operation impossible (e.g. no target for mllp send).

==========

* Evaluate Tiwulfx-dock (https://github.com/panemu/tiwulfx-dock) as Tabbed Browsing base
** Let's keep it for now
* Evaluate JMetro (https://pixelduke.com/java-javafx-theme-jmetro/)
** Let's remove it
* Evaluate SupernautFX (https://www.supernaut.app/SupernautFX/supernaut-user-guide.html) as DI Framework
** Didn't work with eclipse
* Evaluate Google Guice as DI Framework
** Let's continue with the evaluation, looks promising

==========

* WorkbenchFX evaluation
+ Easy to setup, new modules can easily be added
+ Toolbars, Drawers, Dialogs are nice stuff
+ Dirty handling ("Do you want to save?") integrated
- Feels (too) much like a mobile application
- Modules cannot be opened more than once
- Default styling is huge on my desktop

* FormsFX evaluation
+ Nice fluent API
+ I18N Service is nice
- Single column layout is the only one available
- No way to retrieve validation results of a form (self explaining disabled action button)
- No buttons, i.e. no "SearchForm", "DetailForm", etc.; Could provide that on top ...

* i18n
** Conventional vs. Code-Generation Tool?
=> Conventional is just fine
** ResourceBundleEditor?
=> Everybody is invited to find a better tool. If none comes up, we will use ResourceBundleEditor
** Supported languages?
=> en, de
** Should strings like "HL7" or "DICOM" be i18n?
=> yes, we put them in the .properties files

* JavaFX-Libraries to evaluate
** WorkbenchFX?
** FormsFX?
=> yes, we should evaluate this

==========

* Basic design
** GUI: Regular MDI application; tiling etc. to be explored
** GUI and CLI setup simultanously

* Reactive programming to be explored

* GraalVM to be explored / integrated from the start to see if application frameworks work with it

* Common libraries: Preferrably Apache Commons libraries
* Domain libraries: dcm4che, HAPI FHIR, HAPI hl7v2

* CI / CD Pipeline should be setup via GitHub Actions
* sonarqube or other static code check integration to be investigated
* other "badges" / pipelines to be investigated

* Coding Style: 
** indentation by tabs
** avoid multiple returns
=> Proposals of project members welcome

* Documentation
** online help system to be established

* i18n: english as main language, build in translatability
